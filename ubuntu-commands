pwd (print working directory) Ubuntu command displays the full pathname of the current working directory.

cp (copy) Linux command allows you to copy a file. You should specify both the file you want to be copied and the location you want it copied to – for example, cp xyz /home/myfiles would copy the file “xyz” to the directory “/home/myfiles”.

mv (move) command allows you to move files. You can also rename files by moving them to the directory they are currently in, but under a new name. The usage is the same as cp – for example mv xyz /home/myfiles would move the file “xyz” to the directory “/home/myfiles”.

rm (remove) command removes the specified file.

rmdir (“remove directory”) – Removes an empty directory.
rm -r (“remove recursively”) – Removes a directory along with its content.

mkdir (make directory) command allows you to create a new directory. You can specify where you want the directory created – if you do not do so, it will be created in your current working directory.

history command displays all of your previous commands up to the history limit.

df (display filesystem) command displays information about the disk space usage of all mounted filesystems.

du (directory usage) command displays the size of a directory and all of its subdirectories.

free – Displays the amount of free space available on the system.

uname -a – Provides a wide range of basic information about the system.

top – Displays the processes using the most system resources at any given time. “q” can be used to exit.

man command displays a “manual page”. Manual pages are usually very detailed, and it’s recommended that you read the man pages for any command you are unfamiliar with. Some uses are :

man man – Provides information about the manual itself.
man intro – Displays a brief introduction to Linux commands.

Similar to man, but often provides more detailed or precise information.

<command name> -h or <command name> –help
